        <transcript>My name is Lynne Simcox. I live in Seattle WA and I'm a member, a proud member of the Grinnell College class of 1964. I came to Grinnell when I was a juinor in high school. I was aimed for seminary I thought and there was what they call the Prefee conference, Prefee Logical School Conference. It was hosted by Chicago Theological Seminary. It was supposed to be at the Seminary, but they were painting the dorms or something, and so they put a bunch of us on the train and we came to Grinnell for this event.</transcript>

        <transcript>They were people like Howard Burkle and Scott Libby and a couple of others on the panel. Howard Burkle was on the faculty at that point and I fell in love with Grinnell. I really liked it. There was another guy who was there who also fell in love with Grinnell. He was a year older than I and ended up coming and was a part of the class of '63.</transcript>

        <transcript>I went home my parents neither of whom had gone to college never heard of Grinnell of course, and they wanted me to go to college, but they weren't involved in making decisions on that. They were very clear that I could not afford to come to Grinnell so I was going to go to a little school in Missouri. I filled out all the paperwork and everything and the high school counselor invited me to apply for a scholarship for which I was eligible because I lived within a certain part of the south side of the city Chicago and when the guy came from the scholarship group to interview people, I had filled out all the stuff on this other college and he said "Are there any other schools in which you're interested in?"</transcript>

        <transcript>I had put Grinnell. That's all I put. Just Grinnell. Nothing else because I didn't know anything else. I had done no research and he took out a red pencil and said "What's all this about?" and he named the other school in Grinnell. I said "Well I would really like to go to Grinnell, but we can't afford it so I'm going to go to this other school." He took out that red pencil and scratched out everything, but the other school and said "Now let's talk about Grinnell."</transcript>

        <transcript>And I got a scholarship from them before I ever even been accepted at Grinnell. So when I came to Grinnell with a grant made I went into Mr. Saquery's office. He was the head of whatever it is and he said "Oh you're one of Graham Taylor's people. Graham Taylor was one of the guy from the Pullman Foundation. So I came to Grinnell because when I was a junior I fell in love with the campus and because I was given a scholarship.</transcript>

        <transcript>My second or third year my parents came to visit and they went downtown. There was some kind of carnival going on and there was a donkey attached to a telephone and she said "See I told you it was a one horse town. It's not even a horse."</transcript>

        <transcript>The day before I left she said "Grinnell, is it anywhere near Cleveland?"  I said "Iowa mother, Iowa." So unlike many of my classmates who have parents and grandparents who were Grinnell students and who kids went to Grinnell I'm the lone Grinnellian in the bunch. My brother didn't come here and my kids, although I had brought them to Grinnell and their certainly aware of Grinnell, they told me that I should just draw a big circle around the United States and drop it out. So they went to schools on the coasts. They’re really west coast people and that's okay too.</transcript>

        <transcript>I found at Grinnell a kind of openness that was new to me. Having grown up on the south side of Chicago, we were just talking about this outside, in a time of racial change and racial tension, there was a lot of fear and there was a lot of mistrust of people who were different. Now I'm not saying that Grinnell was wide open, but to as many things it is now and to the kind of differences there was, but when I came to Grinnell I felt, and its continued that why we talk about the Grinnell family, that when you're here you're part of the Grinnell family. You belong to a group of people and I found that to be the case.</transcript>

        <transcript>I took a lot of classes from Howard Burkle my favorite professor and friend. He was very important to me. I did go to seminary when I was a senior I applied to two seminaries. One in Boston and one in Berkeley and I was accepted to both. I went in and said "Don't help me decide what I should do. Tell me what to do." and he said "Go to PSR." and that was my first acceptance by PSR so I had already said yes to them. That was already comfortable. That's what I did and of course that changes the rest of your life where you went to graduate school. Regardless of the graduate school often it has a lot to do with the friends that you make and the community that you live in and where you stay for the rest of your working years so that was good.</transcript>

        <transcript>There are ways in which I think Grinnell did not serve me well, and I didn't stand up for myself because I came thinking I wanted to go to seminary I was a sociology major because I didn't want to have to take oral exams on philosophy and religion. Frankly various philosophies and theologies just kind of drive me nuts. Who said what about whom and all that I just can't get into that, but I didn't get challenged to look outside of that box.</transcript>

        <transcript>I wish that I had been forced to take some economics. I wish that someone had pushed me to really look outside of that. I wish I'd taken some theater. I wish that I had been forced to take some economics. I wish that someone had pushed me to really look outside of that. I wish I'd taken some theater. My youngest son has his masters in theater. The theater piece is in there. I did take introduction to acting but I was very self-conscious. Maybe I still am, but I didn't get pushed out of my comfort zone and I wish I had been. I wish I had been in a lot of ways. It would have been challenging and I don't know that I had self confidence that would have allowed me to go into it thinking I could do this. So that was not a good thing.</transcript>

        <transcript>I think that Grinnell was unique in its time. Just when I was waiting to talk to you, I was talking to the guy who was out there about the people who visited the campus when I was here. We had the governors of both Iowa and Nebraska in residence for a week, each of them for a week at a time. We had Harry Truman. We had Arnold Toinby, who’s famous and well-known in certain circles, a historian who was in residence for a semester. Pyramids France was here. Nationally and internationally known people who came and didn’t just fly in, give a lecture and leave immediately, but they were here for long enough, for a long enough time for students to really interact with them in some good kinds of ways. So even though Iowa was, even though Grinnell is seen by some people as less than a one-horse town, it certainly gave you a wider window on the world.</transcript>

        <transcript>I did a lot of babysitting for the family of the Congregational UCC church pastor, Bob and Eleanor Dewey and their kids, so I had a connection with town too, and saw the College through those eyes in ways that some people might not have. It wasn’t just, I wasn’t just isolated on the campus. I think that was good, although I probably shouldn’t have babysat as much, I should’ve, although I need the money, fifty cents an hour you know (laughs), babysit for four kids, all weekend, Friday night through Sunday night, for fifty cents an hour. Yeah, right, but we did. But I probably should’ve been more involved on campus in terms of student things, but that was part of the whole, the shy, reserved thing.</transcript>

        <transcript>I think I really appreciated the way that the faculty and the students interacted. The, my high school for instance, we were not to know where any of the faculty people lived, there was no contact outside of class, there was nothing like that. Grinnell obviously was very different, with Howard Burkle it was very different.</transcript>

        <transcript>My freshman roommate was a woman named Betty Gutman and Betty was a biology major. And at one point we each had a little plant in our room, and mine was a pine tree that died, and she had given it to me. I called it tall crab grass because it was just, like, four inches tall, this little tuft of needles (laughs), and we pressed it, in wax paper, and I gave it to her for Christmas, and then she gave it to me for my birthday, and it went back and forth and back and forth.</transcript>

        <transcript>So we had oral comp I don’t know if you have it now, but we had senior comprehensive exam, oral comprehensive exams, and you had to go in and you could be examined on anything and every class that you had taken in all four years. And we lived in the fear of the Lord for those oral exams, and if you didn’t pass them your name would be in the graduation program but there would be a little asterisk that said ‘has not met the requirements for graduation.’ Well Betty was a very good student, and a biology major as I said.</transcript>

        <transcript>Benjamin Graham was the faculty person who was the tree man, and I went in to him and told him the story of tall crab grass, and I said, “Don’t you think that during oral exams, a student should be able to identify a specimen?” and he said “Absolutely.” So he took the tall crab grass thing, and Betty went in to her oral exams and they had divided the faculty into two groups, and he was not on her panel, and she was so tense, so nervous, and at the end of it Doctor Fishman reached into his pocket and said “Doctor Graham has sent in another question for you.”</transcript>

        <transcript>And she told me later that she just panicked, what had she done that Doctor Graham would send in a question for her? And he pulled tall crab grass out of his pocket and said “Could you please identify this specimen?” and she just lost it. I mean, that’s the, the kind of rapport with faculty and students that I think is wonderful, I don’t know if it happens in other kinds of places.</transcript>

        <transcript>Well you see, I spent a lot of years in campus ministry before I went on to be a middle Judicatory executive kind of thing, so I was around a lot of colleges and universities. And I think that unlike commuter schools and large universities, Grinnell has a sense of family that you don’t have in a lot of places. You might have it at the University of Montana, because of the location, to a certain extent, but if you’re a Grinnellian, you’re family. There’s no question about that, there’s just, there’s a connection there, there’s a tie.</transcript>

        <transcript>There’s a woman that I see in a class that I’m taking in Seattle, she is much younger than I, but she’s also a Grinnellian, and we’ve got that, oh, you know, you’re a Grinnellian! My son brings people to me, he says “You should know her, she’s a Grinnellian!” Okay. Anyway, it’s good. I wished I’d been pushed out of my box, but other than that, Grinnell was great. That enough?</transcript>
